The first and probably last post about cycling i'll ever write.
 - broad opening: total disappointment in cycling
 - constituents (racers [current pros, amateurs], promoters, fans, governing bodies)
 - complete disappointment across every group
 - failure to educate audience
 - failure to support aspiring athletes
 - failure to lead and make good business decisions

 - but narrower conclusion: always a fan, necessary part of identity, cannot shake.
